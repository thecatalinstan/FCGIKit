/**
An `FKRoutingCenter` object (or simply, routing center) provides a mechanism
for specifying which controllers and views should be called for a particular
request path. An `FKRoutingCenter` object is essentially a routing table.

Objects can request a specific route from the routing center using the 
`routeForRequestURI:` method or get `allRoutes`.

Each running FCGIKit application has a shared center. You typically don’t create
your own. The `FKApplicaion` shared instance tipically handles the resolution 
of routes so you should not have to call any of these methods yourself.

Routes are specified in the bundles `Info.plist` file using the `FKRoutingKey`.
